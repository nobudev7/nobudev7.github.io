Hi, I'm a long time backend developer, mostly using Java. In my daily work, I work on Java web backend, always thinking high performance, reliable, and maintainable bode base for a large scale website. In my free time, I'm still thinking the same, but for my own projects - that require operations, UI, budgeting, security, etc. 

See my project in [my GitHub account](https://github.com/nobudev7).
