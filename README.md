# Nobu's "blog" website
Using GitHub pages feature, powered by Jekyll, this repository is to create my blog site.
Originally used DEV.io, however, there is a bug in editor that can't retain the content, I moved my contents there.
The blog is mostly for my record of operations I did for various projects. Mostly about Spring Boot, AWS (Lightsaild though), Docker, etc.
